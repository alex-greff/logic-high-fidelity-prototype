# logic-high-fidelity-prototype
High fidelity prototype of the Logic 2010 redesign for CSCC10

## First Time Setup
- Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Run ```npm install``` in the repo's root directory so install the needed libraries. 

## Development
- Before coding run ```npm run compile:sass-watch``` and keep the command-line instance open. This will compile the sass scripts to css everytime a change is made as long as the window is open. **OR** run ``` npm run compile:sass``` to compile all the sass script once.
- **Viewing changes:** Since the site is static, simply opening the html file is enough to view it properly.

...And that's about it!
